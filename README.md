    Solution for the Coding exercise
    ================================

    Run the restaurant.py to check the solution.

    Make sure each order is processed within 20 minutes or less or reject the order if the kitchen canâ€™t process it within 20 minutes. Each order could also get rejected if the branch runs out of inventory.
    (I have assumption that this means the order needs to finished in 21*60 secs max)

    -[x] Creation of multiple restaurants.
        Currently i have only created one restaurant but if required we can easily create a function 
        to read multiple lines and create restaurant out of it.
        If the order line has multiple restaurants it might not work currently.
    
## Test case

    The python script restaurant_test.py consist the test cases for the all the objects and functions in the restaurant file.
